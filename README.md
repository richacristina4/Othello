# Othello
Welcome to the Othello Game project! This repository hosts a Python implementation of the classic board game Othello, also known as Reversi. Othello is a strategy game played on an 8x8 grid where two players take turns placing their colored discs (black and white) on the board, with the goal of capturing and flipping their opponent's discs to gain control of the board.
